      Kuala Perlis is a cozy coastal town known for its seafood, especially the ikan bakar (grilled fish). The restaurants near the jetty serve up fresh fish, often paired with gulai ikan, a rich, flavorful curry made with fish. The combination of freshly grilled fish and spicy curry is a must-try when you're there.

    Roti canai is one of Malaysia’s favorite breakfast items. It’s a flatbread that’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, usually served with curry or dhal. Roti canai sarang burung is a fun twist on the classic. It's shaped like a "bird's nest," with the flatbread curled up around a sunny-side-up egg in the middle. It looks cool and tastes even better.

    At the Kangar market, nasi kandar is the go-to meal for many. It’s a rice dish served with various curries and side dishes. The best part is the kuah campur, where they mix different types of curry gravies over your rice, creating a rich, flavorful blend that makes every bite special.
