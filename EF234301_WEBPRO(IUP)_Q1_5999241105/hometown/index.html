    One thing that really stands out in Perlis is the paddy fields. They're everywhere! During planting or harvesting seasons, the whole landscape turns this lush green or golden yellow, making it look like something out of a postcard. The fields are iconic, and they give the state a super scenic, rural charm. It’s just relaxing to drive through and see the stretches of paddy under a wide-open sky.
